### What is it?

This is a online QR code reader that allows you to scan a QR code from you device camera. It also allows you to generate a QR code from a text, in wich you can download the image as a file to your machine.

Its made with [Typescript ](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/), [qrcode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode), [react-qr-reader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-qr-reader) ( also other small libs like react-dom).
